            Hi, I'm Mohamed, a recent graduate from Abd Elmalek Essaadi University with a bachelor's degree in
             Mathematics and Computer Science. As a junior developer, I have a solid foundation in programming, 
             with a focus on full-stack development using Spring Boot and React.js. My academic background has 
             equipped me with strong analytical and problem-solving skills, which I apply daily to build efficient 
             and scalable web applications.
             <br/><br/>
            Iâ€™m passionate about technology and constantly learning new frameworks and tools to expand my expertise.
             Whether it's creating dynamic front-end experiences or developing robust back-end systems, 
             I enjoy the challenge of transforming ideas into functional, user-friendly solutions.
